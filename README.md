quick notes:
create_dataset.py and summarise.py made the chat-langchain-v3-selected dataset (https://smith.langchain.com/o/ebbaf2eb-769b-4505-aca2-d11de10372a4/datasets/af1dd414-01ab-4a4e-8351-8a4ec86f7b85?tab=1) what it looks like now.
base_cluster.py is the main clustering algorithm implementation, and I'm now realizing I need to update the name because it's not just base clusters anymore. This is the only file to run to recreate results.
the clustering_results directory contains the each layer of summarization as a csv file 
the initial_results files are just rough/saving my terminal output
