Cluster 12: Implement voice chat application with
custom audio detection and logging
Description: This group of
statements requested help implementing voice chat applications with specific
features like voice activity detection, packet logging, and audio input/output
device selection. The users wanted to build these capabilities without external
libraries while being able to distinguish between voice and noise packets and log
client connection details.
Size: 7 conversations
Sample summaries: ['implement a voice chat application with the ability to select audio input and output devices, detect voice versus noise, and log relevant information about the voice packets and client connections.', 'help set up and integrate an MCP (Model Context Protocol) client within a FastAPI application, and to provide feedback and suggestions for improving the implementation.', 'help them implement a voice chat application with features like voice activity detection, packet logging, and client-side noise reduction, without using additional libraries.']

Cluster 13: Build engineering data QA system with knowledge graph query
generation
Description: Users requested help
building an AI-powered system that could understand natural language questions
about engineering data and retrieve answers from a knowledge graph. The system
needed to rewrite questions into graph queries, execute code to access the data,
handle errors, and support interactive conversations.
Size: 9 conversations
Sample summaries: ['build an AI-powered engineering data question-answering system that can retrieve and summarize relevant information from a knowledge graph, and rewrite user questions into Cypher queries to search the graph.', "implement a system that can answer questions about engineering data stored in a graph knowledge base, by extracting relevant information and rewriting the user's question into a query against the graph.", 'build an AI-powered system that can understand natural language queries, retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, and generate code to access engineering data, with the ability to handle multiple rounds of interaction and provide results to the user.']

Looking at the clusters, I see several major themes:
1. Development/debugging of multi-agent and routing systems (LangGraph
supervisor, state management, tool calling)
2. Data retrieval and query sys...
